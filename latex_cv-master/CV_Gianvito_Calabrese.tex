\addblocktext{Summary}{%
I was born the 3rd of September 1992 in Bari where I spent my first 26 years. Afterwards I have settled in various places in Italy, everytime moved by the aim of better growth opportunities. I am a dedicated, creative and proactive physicist with three years job experience in the semiconductor related applications. I have designed novel devices and carried out experiments as academic technologist. I possess excellent analytical and communications skills and this allowed me to successfully move from university to industry in the role of yield enhancement engineer. I have spent my life always looking for opportunities to utilize my technical skills in a challenging working environment and become a valuable asset to the organization I work for.
